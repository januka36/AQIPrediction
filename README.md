Development of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms for air quality modeling and forecasting. Time series data-set is used to analyse, implement and train existing models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Facebook Prophet, GRU and LSTM etc. During the internship my task was to explore further approaches for more accurate forecasting.
